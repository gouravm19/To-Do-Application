### Client's Document for To-Do Application Requirements
 
---

**Client's Notes:**

We need a simple to-do list application that our team can use to keep track of tasks. Here are some of the things we want:

1. **User Accounts**:
   - Users should be able to create an account and log in.
   - We need a way to reset passwords if someone forgets theirs.

2. **Task Management**:
   - Users should be able to add new tasks.
   - Each task should have a title and a description.
   - Users should be able to mark tasks as completed.
   - There should be an option to edit or delete tasks.

3. **Task Organization**:
   - It would be great if users could categorize tasks (e.g., Work, Personal).
   - We want to see tasks in a list format.
   - Users should be able to filter tasks by category or completion status.

4. **Notifications**:
   - Users should get reminders for upcoming tasks.
   - Notifications can be via email or in-app.

5. **User Interface**:
   - The app should be easy to use and navigate.
   - We prefer a clean and modern design.

6. **Security**:
   - Ensure user data is secure.
   - Implement basic security measures to protect against unauthorized access.

7. **Performance**:
   - The app should load quickly and handle multiple users without lag.

8. **Mobile Access**:
   - It would be nice if the app works well on mobile devices too.

9. **Miscellaneous**:
   - We might want to add more features later, so keep the code flexible.
   - Provide some basic documentation on how to use the app.
